## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

##Exercise: Explore, Clean, and Wrangle Data
```{r}
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyr)
library(here)
```

#read the data
```{r}
lobster_abundance <- read_csv("practice session/data/Lobster_Abundance_All_Years_20220829.csv")
```

##convert missing values
```{r}
lobster_abundance <- lobster_abundance %>% 
    mutate(SIZE_MM = na_if(SIZE_MM, -99999))
```

##subset with no observ from napl
```{r}
not_napl <- lobster_abundance %>% 
    filter(SITE != "NAPL")
```

##Create and store a subset with lobsters at Arroyo Quemado (AQUE) AND with a carapace length bigger than 70 mm
```{r}

aque_70mm <- lobster_abundance %>% 
    filter(SITE == "AQUE" & SIZE_MM >= 70)
```

##group and summarize
```{r}
# `group_by() %>% summarize()` practice

max_lobster <- lobster_abundance %>% 
  group_by(SITE, MONTH) %>% 
  summarize(MAX_LENGTH = max(SIZE_MM, na.rm = TRUE))
```

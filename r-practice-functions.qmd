## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
```

```{r}
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed

```{r}
library(rvest)
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(janitor)
```
```{r}
webpage <- rvest::read_html("https://www.pwrc.usgs.gov/BBL/Bander_Portal/login/speclist.php")

tbls <- rvest::html_nodes(webpage, "table") %>% 
    rvest::html_table(fill = TRUE)

species <- tbls[[1]] %>% 
    janitor::clean_names() %>% 
    select(alpha_code, common_name) %>% 
    mutate(alpha_code = tolower(alpha_code))

head(species, 3)
```

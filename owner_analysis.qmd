## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

##Exercise: Explore, Clean, and Wrangle Data
```{r}
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyr)
library(here)
```

#read the data
```{r}
lobster_abundance <- read_csv("practice session/data/Lobster_Abundance_All_Years_20220829.csv")
```

```
